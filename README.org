This is an Emacs package that includes a Latin-English dictionary.

** Installation

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
#+end_src


If you use straight.el and use-package:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package
 latin-words
 :ensure t
 :straight
 (latin-words :type git :host github :repo "enigmacurry/latin-words")
 :custom
 (latin-words-directory
  (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/straight/repos/latin-words/data")))
#+end_src

By default, the =latin-words-directory= is set to the =data= directory
beneath the directory containing =latin-words.el=, however straight.el
separates the elisp code from the data files, so you must customize
=latin-words-directory= to be the path to the place where your package
manager clones this repository to and find the =data= directory
beneath that (e.g., =~/.emacs.d/straight/repos/latin-words/data=).

** Usage

#+begin_src elisp
  ;; Get full description string for Latin word "adbibo":
  (latin-word-get-description "adbibo")

  ;; Get definition hashmap for Latin word "adbibo" decoded from the JSON:
  (latin-word-get-definition "adbibo")

  ;; Get a "random" deterministic Latin word (just the word) based on numeric seed:
  (latin-word-get-by-seed 1234567890)

  ;; Get the description for the word of the day:
  (latin-word-get-description (latin-word-of-the-day))
#+end_src
