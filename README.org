#+title: Latin Words

This is an Emacs package that includes a Latin-English dictionary.

[[latin-words.webp]]

[[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059]["A Latin Dictionary"]] by Charlton T. Lewis and Charles Short is

3.0 License]]. The intermediate JSON files for this dataset came from
[[https://github.com/IohannesArnold/lewis-short-json][IohannesArnold/lewis-short-json]] and the original XML files are

** Installation

This package is only availble on github for now.

There is one external program dependency (to be refactoired out in a
future release): [[https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download/][jq]]

Here is how I install it with [[https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el][straight.el]] and [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]]:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package
 latin-words
 :ensure t
 :straight
 (latin-words :type git :host github :repo "enigmacurry/latin-words")
 :custom
 (latin-words-directory
  (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/straight/repos/latin-words/data")))
#+end_src

By default, the =latin-words-directory= is set to the =data= directory
beneath the directory containing =latin-words.el=, however straight.el
separates the elisp code from the data files, so you must customize
=latin-words-directory= to be the actual path where your package
manager (e.g. straight.el) clones this repository to, and then find
the =data= directory beneath that (e.g.,
=~/.emacs.d/straight/repos/latin-words/data=).

** Usage

#+begin_src elisp
  (require 'latin-words)
  
  ;; Get full description string for Latin word "adbibo":
  (latin-word-get-description "adbibo")

  ;; Get definition hashmap for Latin word "adbibo" decoded from the JSON:
  (latin-word-get-definition "adbibo")

  ;; Get a "random" deterministic Latin word (just the word) based on numeric seed:
  (latin-word-get-by-seed 1234567890)

  ;; Get the description for the word of the day:
  (latin-word-get-description (latin-word-of-the-day))
#+end_src

** Dashboard integration and Word of the Day

Put the Latin word of the day on your [[https://github.com/emacs-dashboard/emacs-dashboard][Emacs dashboard]]:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package
 dashboard
 :ensure t
 :init
 (defun my-dashboard-insert-vocabulary (list-size)
   (dashboard-insert-heading "Word of the day:" nil)
   (insert "\n")
   (let* ((char-limit 100000)
          (word (latin-word-of-the-day))
          (description (latin-word-get-description word)))
     (insert
      (substring description
                 0
                 (min char-limit (length description))))))
 (dashboard-setup-startup-hook)
 :custom
 (dashboard-center-content t)
 (dashboard-set-heading-icons nil)
 (dashboard-set-file-icons nil)
 (dashboard-icon-type nil)
 (dashboard-footer-messages (list "    "))
 (dashboard-items '((recents . 5) (bookmarks . 5) (vocabulary)))
 (dashboard-startup-banner (+ 1 (random 3)))
 (dashboard-item-generators
  '((vocabulary . my-dashboard-insert-vocabulary)
    (recents . dashboard-insert-recents)
    (bookmarks . dashboard-insert-bookmarks))))
